# MakeLabelForMarket-Duke
Matlab codes for making training and testing labels of Market-1501 Attribute and DukeMTMC-attribute Dataset.

### Usage
a) Download attribute labels for Market-1501 Dataset and DukeMTMC-reID Dataset from [vana77/Market-1501_Attribute](https://github.com/vana77/Market-1501_Attribute) and [vana77/DukeMTMC-attribute ](https://github.com/vana77/DukeMTMC-attribute);

b) Run `market_id_attr_label_train.m` to get ID labels and attribute labels for training set of Market-1501;

c) Run `market_attr_label_test.m` to get attribute labels for testing set of Market-1501;

d) Run other two m-files for DukeMTMC-reID respondingly.
